When creating the IPA for publish you might get the following error:

"Invalid Swift Support - The SwiftSupport folder is missing. Rebuild your app using the current public (GM) version of Xcode and resubmit it."

The following script will help: https://github.com/jamesbar2/auto-ipa-packager or https://github.com/bq/ipa-packager
